<p style="font-size:18px;">Welcome! I am Leyao (Laura) Wang, an incoming <a href="https://engineering.yale.edu/academic-study/departments/computer-science/graduate-study/master-science-program"> 2-year MSCS</a> at <a href="https://www.yale.edu/"> Yale University</a>. I obtained the Bachelor of Science from <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/"> Vanderbilt University</a> with <a href="https://registrar.vanderbilt.edu/academic-records/latin-honors.php"> summa cum laude </a> (the highest honor), double majoring in <a href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/departments/computer-science/"> Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/math/"> Mathematics</a> and minoring in <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/datascience/"> Data Science</a>. In the past, I was fortunate to work with Dr.<a href="https://tylersnetwork.github.io/"> Tyler Derr</a>  in <a href="https://nds-vu.github.io/">Network Data Science (NDS) Lab</a> at Vanderbilt, Dr. <a href="https://bme.duke.edu/people/pranam-chatterjee/"> Pranam Chatterjee</a>  in <a href="https://www.chatterjeelab.com/">The Programmable Biology Group (PBG)</a> at Duke University, and Dr. <a href="https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics/person/zhijun-yin/"> Zhijun Yin</a> from the Vanderbilt SPHERE lab.</p>


Research Interests
======

 My research interests mainly focus on Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models, including:

- **Trustworthy AI**: Enhancing the robustness of large language models (LLM) and aligning them with human values through fine-tuning, in-context learning (ICL), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), etc.
- **Data-Centric AI**: Utilizing large language models (LLM) to tackle data quality challenges, including class imbalance, data sparsity, and missing values, through advanced text generation techniques.
- **AI for Science**: Applying large language models (LLM) in scientific domains, such as encoding molecule or peptide sequences for chemical property representation.
