**Welcome!** I am Leyao(Laura) Wang, a senior student at Vanderbilt University double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Data Science. I am currently advised by Dr.Tyler Derr at Vanderbilt Network Data Science (NDS) Lab and Dr. Pranam Chatterjee in The Programmable Biology Group(PBG) at Duke University. In the past, I was fortunate to work with Dr. Zhijun Yin in the Vanderbilt SPHERE lab.

Research Interests
======
 My research interests mainly focus on Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models, including:

- **Trustworthy AI**: Enhancing the robustness of large language models (LLM) and aligning them with human values through fine-tuning, in-context learning (ICL), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), etc.
- **Data-Centric AI**: Utilizing large language models (LLM) to tackle data quality challenges, including class imbalance, labeling inaccuracies, and missing values, through advanced text generation techniques.
- **AI for Science**: Applying large language models (LLM) in scientific domains, such as encoding molecule or peptide sequences for chemical property representation.
